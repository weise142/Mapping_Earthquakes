# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
This project consists of creating multiple maps to illustrate earthquake data in relation to tectonic plate locations. This project will show all of the earthquakes on the map with a magnitude of 4.5 or greater. 
## Project and Outcomes
The objective of the project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API and then use this information to create and explore interactive maps. The below images show maps of earthquakes around the world in the past seven days and have different view settings; Street, Satellite, and Dark. The three overlays can be toggled fo any combination or view and pop-up circle markers are added to mark where each of the earthquakes took place and show the magnitude of the earthquakes. The radius of each circle is proportional to the size of the earthquake and the colors are determined by the magnitude, as shown in the legends of the maps:
